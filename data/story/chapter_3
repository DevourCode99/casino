      "keyTakeaway": "Licensees may sign, but not alter, unapproved forms.",
      "exampleStory": "Sarah, a real estate agent, was hired by a bank to sell a foreclosed property. The bank provided its own listing contract, which was not a Wisconsin-approved form. Sarah noticed it lacked a section for her rights to protected buyers and tried to add it herself. Her broker explained that Wis. Admin. Code § REEB 16.06 prohibits licensees from modifying unapproved forms. Sarah signed the bank’s contract as is but ensured she provided a separate Disclosure to Clients form to comply with state law."

      "exampleStory": "John listed his duplex with the help of his agent, Michelle. Michelle explained that under Wis. Stat. Chapter 709, John was required to complete a real estate condition report within 10 days of accepting an offer.

John completed the report, which helped the buyer make an informed decision and avoided potential legal disputes."

      "exampleStory": "Lisa, an agent, was helping her clients sell a home with a well. She attached a pre-prepared WRA Addendum A for well testing to the WB-11 Residential Offer to Purchase but forgot to reference it in the main contract.

      "exampleStory": "Joe, a salesperson, was assisting with a transaction involving a land contract. He decided to complete a State Bar-approved form for the land contract.

Mark corrected his process and ensured that all parties received proper disclosures in future transactions."
