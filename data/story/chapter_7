      "exampleStory": "Tom, a newly licensed broker, wanted to open his own real estate firm. He submitted his application for a sole proprietorship through the DSPS online portal, but started listing properties before the license was issued.

After this, he carefully followed the process, ensuring compliance with DSPS regulations."

      "exampleStory": "Sarah wanted to open her firm as a sole proprietorship but was concerned about personal liability.

      "exampleStory": "A buyer sued a firm, claiming the agent had failed to disclose a material defect in a property.

    {
      "keyTakeaway": "Brokers must comply with advertising rules.",

Code § REEB 24.04 allows exceptions for personally owned rental properties, all other advertisements must clearly display the firm’s name. Rachel updated her advertising practices to ensure compliance."

    {
      "keyTakeaway": "Brokers must ensure accurate advertising data.",
      "exampleStory": "Emily advertised a property’s lot size as \"100 x 200,\" but the dimensions were later found to be inaccurate. Because the ad included the source as \"per tax records,\" Emily avoided liability. This demonstrated the importance of citing data sources in advertising to mitigate risk."

      "exampleStory": "A firm filed a commission lien on a commercial property after the seller failed to pay the agreed-upon commission. By following the notice and lien perfection steps outlined in Wis. Stat. § 779.32, the firm secured payment after the property sale."
