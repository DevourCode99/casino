      "keyTakeaway": "Licensees play a vital role in consumer protection through education.",
      "exampleStory": "Karen was selling her home for the first time in 25 years. Her agent, Alex, explained every step of the process, including the requirement to provide a real estate condition report. Karen was surprised to learn that failing to complete the report within 10 days of accepting an offer could give the buyer the right to rescind. Alex’s guidance ensured Karen complied with Wis. Stat. Chapter 709, avoiding potential delays and disputes. This demonstrated how licensees educate consumers to navigate legal requirements."

      "exampleStory": "When buyer Beth asked her agent, Tom, to write an offer on a property, she assumed Tom represented her interests.

Stat. § 452.134 ensured she complied with the law while maintaining consumer trust."
