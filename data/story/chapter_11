      "keyTakeaway": "CMAs help sellers determine competitive list prices.",
      "exampleStory": "Lisa, a real estate licensee, conducted a comparative market analysis (CMA) for a seller considering listing their home. She compared the property to three recently sold homes, two active listings, and one expired listing. Adjusting for differences like square footage, updates, and location, Lisa provided a probable market value range. This helped the seller decide on a competitive list price while leaving room for negotiation."

      "keyTakeaway": "Licensees can provide CMAs for non-transactional purposes.",
      "exampleStory": "A local attorney contacted Josh, a licensee, to perform a CMA for an estate settlement. The CMA helped establish the fair market value of the deceased's home.

      "keyTakeaway": "Appraisals provide unbiased property valuations for lenders.",
      "exampleStory": "After a buyer submitted an offer, the lender ordered an appraisal to confirm the property’s value. The appraiser’s analysis considered neighborhood trends and recent comparable sales. Unlike Lisa’s CMA, which aimed to support the seller's goals, the appraiser’s primary objective was to protect the lender’s investment by ensuring the home’s value justified the loan amount."

      "exampleStory": "Maria used a conventional loan to buy her first home. She only had 10% for a down payment, so her lender required PMI. Maria learned she could request PMI removal once her equity reached 20%, potentially saving her hundreds of dollars annually."

      "exampleStory": "Chris used a balloon loan to purchase a property.

      "exampleStory": "A buyer used a purchase money mortgage from the seller to cover 10% of the purchase price. This second mortgage supplemented the buyer’s 10% down payment and the 80% financed by the bank, enabling the buyer to complete the transaction without additional cash reserves."
