      "keyTakeaway": "Firms cannot hold non-depositable items like stock certificates as earnest money.",
      "exampleStory": "A buyer offered a car title as earnest money for a property. The firm informed the parties that such items are non-depositable and could not be held in the firm’s trust account. Instead, they recommended using an escrow agreement drafted by an attorney, per Wis. Admin. Code § REEB 18.11."
    },
    {
      "keyTakeaway": "Earnest money must be deposited within 48 hours of receipt.",
      "exampleStory": "When Alex received a buyer’s earnest money on a Friday, he ensured it was deposited into the firm’s trust account by Tuesday, as the bank was closed over the weekend.

Code § REEB 18.09, the firm resolved the issue ethically and legally."

      "exampleStory": "To cover bank service fees, Mary’s firm kept $300 of personal funds in the trust account, as allowed by Wis. Admin. Code § REEB 18.10. This ensured compliance while avoiding accidental commingling of personal and client funds."

    {
      "keyTakeaway": "Parties must use escrow agreements for funds not held by the firm.",
      "exampleStory": "A buyer and seller wanted their earnest money to accrue interest. The firm informed them that it could not hold the funds for this purpose. Instead, the parties had an attorney draft an escrow agreement, ensuring compliance with Wis. Admin. Code § REEB 18.06."
    },
    {
      "keyTakeaway": "Title insurance protects buyers and lenders from title defects.",
      "exampleStory": "During a transaction, the title company discovered an undisclosed easement. The seller resolved the issue by providing an owner’s affidavit and obtaining a lien waiver.

      "keyTakeaway": "Closing statements must accurately reflect transaction details.",
      "exampleStory": "A seller asked their agent for an estimate of net proceeds. The agent prepared a trial closing statement, accounting for prorated taxes, commissions, and mortgage payoffs. By providing this estimate, the agent helped the seller make an informed decision while preparing for the actual closing."

    {
      "keyTakeaway": "Prorations ensure fair allocation of property expenses and income.",
      "exampleStory": "In a closing, the buyer and seller prorated property taxes based on the previous year’s tax bill. The seller’s share was credited to the buyer, who would pay the full tax bill later. This standard proration method aligned with Wisconsin real estate practices."

      "exampleStory": "After a property sale closed, Jane’s firm disbursed the earned commission from the trust account within 24 hours, as required by Wis. Admin. Code § REEB 18.09. This prompt action avoided any potential disputes or delays."
    },
    {
      "keyTakeaway": "Brokers must manage property management funds appropriately.",
      "exampleStory": "A firm handling rental properties deposited tenant security deposits into a non-interest-bearing trust account, while monthly rents were deposited directly into the owner’s account. These practices complied with Wis. Admin. Code § REEB 18.031 and avoided misuse of tenant funds."
